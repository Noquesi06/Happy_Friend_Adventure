Hi! This a version i made on collegue using C and ncurses
Its an rpg focused on a visual novel style. It doesn't have any maps and the game loop is basically: Dialogue -> Boss fight -> Dialogue -> Again

I'm uploading this version because i want to evolve it into a new game using raylib in order to transform this project into something closer to an RPG Maker–style game
(maps, sprites, and more :D).
Basically, this code will be a "Ship of Theseus". 

Current content of this old version:
- Unicode art (Only for bosses).
- Attack / Defense / Evasion system (For both player and bosses --bosses can only attack!).
- Merchant system to let the player increase their stats
- UI based on ncurses.

Content that this version doesn't have:
- Music.
- Mobs.
- Maps.
- A proper rpg interface (such as maps).
- Item system for player.
- Unique abilities for each boss.
- Boss 5 and 6 are currently disabled.
- Endings A and B (Each one involve boss 5 or 6).
- Decision system (Where the player decides what to do against any defeated boss).

As i say in the first secion of this readme, this version is outdated and i don't plan to update it.
That beacuse i want to rework the current code in order to migrate from ncurses to raylib and build a complete RPG game based on this content.
